# Running Hackolade Studio Command Line Interface in Docker containers

This repository contains instructions and files for running Hackolade Studio CLI using our official Docker image which can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hackolade/studio/tags).  This image doesn't contain Hackolade Studio but provides a preconfigured runtime for running it inside Docker containers.

Check [How to run Hackolade Studio with Docker](./Studio/README.md) in [./Studio subfolder](./Studio) for details.
